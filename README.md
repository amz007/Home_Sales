# Home Sales

## Overview
This project is part of the Module 22 Challenge and involves using SparkSQL to perform data analysis on a home sales dataset. The goal is to determine key metrics about home sales, including average prices for homes with specific characteristics. Additionally, we will use Spark's features to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache tables, and measure performance differences between cached and uncached queries.

## Project Structure
- Home_Sales.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the code to perform the analysis.
- home_sales_revised.csv: The dataset used for this analysis (not included in this repository).
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Results
The analysis will help in understanding the performance differences between cached and uncached data as well as the impact of partitioning the data on query performance.

## Resources
In class assigments, homework and ChatGPT were used to help with code.
